# Contributing to RTSL Utils

## …for code changes

We communicate in RTSL through concrete artefacts. What this means in the Github world is issues, and pull requests. If you have ideas on how any of our utils could be better, or you can help with an already open issue, please raise a pull request with the following guidelines

- commits should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines
- ensure the pull request description properly details the problem and the solution
    - link the issue being treated, if available

If you want to contribute an entirely new feature, do raise an issue so we can discuss it beforehand. This helps smoothen the pull request review process.

## …for bugs

1. Search for the bug through our Github issues
1. If the bug exists, add your scenario to the thread so we know this bug is affecting more people
1. If the bug is new, please create a new Github issue ensuring you have the following detail in it
    1. a clear title and description
    1. the specific util you found the bug in

We're looking forward to collaborating with you and everyone in the community :rocket:
