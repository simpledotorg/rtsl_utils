Feature: Audit the PI - HTN PUC registered before 3 months and is controlled in the last 3 months
  ____
  As a tester
  Given I have a few tracked entity instances with event history in the system
  When  I export the analytics and run the hypertension data aggregation
  Then  I should see the "HTN PUC registered before 3 months and is controlled in the last 3 months" program indicator data for each month as expected
  ____

  Scenario: All patients should be hypertensive
    Given I create a new OrgUnit
    And I assign the current user to the current orgUnit

    And I create a new TEI on "7_MonthsAgo" for this Facility with the following attributes
