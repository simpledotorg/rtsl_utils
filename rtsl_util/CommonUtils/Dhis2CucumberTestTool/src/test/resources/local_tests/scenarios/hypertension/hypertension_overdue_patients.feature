Feature: Number of overdue patients
  ____
  As a tester
  Given I have a few tracked entity instances with event history in the system
  When  I export the analytics and run the hypertension data aggregation
  Then  I should see the "HTN - Overdue patients" program indicator data for each month as expected
  ____

  Scenario: All patients has to be hypertensive
    Given I am signed in as a user with role "Superuser"
    And I have access to an organisation unit at level 5
    And I register that organisation unit for program "Hypertension & Diabetes"

    Given I create a new TEI on "7_MonthsAgo" for this Facility with the following attributes
