Feature: Number of overdue patients
  ____
  As a tester
  Given I have a few tracked entity instances with event history in the system
  When  I export the analytics and run the hypertension data aggregation
  Then  I should see the "HTN - Overdue patients" program indicator data for each month as expected
  ____

  Scenario: All patients has to be hypertensive
    Given I am signed in as a user with role "Superuser"
    And I have access to an organisation unit at level 5
    And I register that organisation unit for program "Hypertension & Diabetes"

    Given I create a new TEI on "7_MonthsAgo" for this Facility with the following attributes
      | GEN - Given name                      | Priyanka     |

    And That TEI has a "Hypertension & Diabetes visit" event on "7_MonthsAgo" with following data

      | Diastole | 95  |
    And That TEI has a "Hypertension & Diabetes visit" event scheduled for "6_MonthsAgo"

    And I create a new TEI on "7_MonthsAgo" for this Facility with the following attributes

      | Systole  | 142 |
      | Diastole | 95  |
    And That TEI has a "Hypertension & Diabetes visit" event scheduled for "6_MonthsAgo"

    When I wait for 1 second
    And I export the analytics

    Then The value of "PI":"HTN - Overdue patients" with period type "Months" should be
      | thisMonth    | 1 |
